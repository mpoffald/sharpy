Requirements
============

Inside a virtualenv, run:

.. code::

Installing elementtree for Unit Testing
=======================================================
When trying to install elementtree, pip may report that there is no such package. If this happens to you, you can work around by downloading and installing it manually.

.. code::

    wget http://effbot.org/media/downloads/elementtree-1.2.6-20050316.zip
    unzip elementtree-1.2.6-20050316.zip
    cd elementtree-1.2.6-20050316/
    pip install .
